    - What is a "Unit" in Unit Testing?

    - What *can't* a Unit Test involve in the test?
    Code that does not involve logic
    - What is the diference between external and internal code quality? 
    External quality control maintains long term accuracy.
    Internal quality control monitors the daily precision and accuracy of methodologies, personnell, and instruments. 
        - What is "coupling"?
        Cohesion is about how well elements within a module belong together and serve a common purpose.  
        - What is "cohesion"?
        Coupling is about how much one module depends or interacts with other modules.
    - What is "Test First"?
    Writing unit code before application code is written.
    - What is "Test After"?
    Writing application code and then writes a unit test after the application code is written. 
    - What is "Test-Driven-Development"?
    Method of implementing software programming that interlaces unit testing, programming and refactoring on source code. 
        - What are the steps of TDD?
